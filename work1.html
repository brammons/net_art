            <p id="work1bio">This piece is a digital poetry experience composed of “lifted halftone pictures, darting sequences, texts with infinite variants, windows and moments closing and opening endlessly”. Amisola says that the piece was the product of a dream they had. It revolves around the idea of “wanting to be touched, to regain sensitivity for the enormity of life around [them].” This work was featured in <a href="https://nowplaythis.net/">Now Play This</a>, a festival of experimental game design.
