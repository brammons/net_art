            <h2>We Are Only Moving Towards Each Other, <em>2023</em>, Interactive Typography & Photography Website</h2>
            <p>This piece is a digital poetry experience composed of “lifted halftone pictures, darting sequences, texts with infinite variants, windows and moments closing and opening endlessly”. Amisola says that the piece was the product of a dream she had. It revolves around the idea of “wanting to be touched, to regain sensitivity for the enormity of life around [her].” This work was featured in Now Play This, a festival of experimental game design.</p>
