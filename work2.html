            <p>This piece is “a tiny gamemaker that is a game in itself”. The site allows “players” to make a game themselves by playing Amisola’s game. Amisola notes that this project was their undergraduate thesis project. This project is featured in an article by <a href="https://outland.art/chia-amisola/">Outland</a>. Click that controller to experience it yourself!</p>
